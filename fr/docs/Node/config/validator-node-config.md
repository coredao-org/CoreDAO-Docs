# Validator Node Configuration

---

Validators are crucial for securing the network by producing blocks and validating transactions within the Core Chain’s Satoshi Plus consensus framework.

## System Requirements

There are several system requirements, both software and hardware, for setting up a validator node on the Core network.

### Software

- Currently, a Core Validator Node can only run on **Mac OS X** or on the **Linux** operating systems.

### Hardware

Core nodes perform several resource-intensive tasks, which can include storing blockchain data, verifying blocks or transactions, communicating with peer nodes, and answering network requests, depending on their configuration. Each type of Core node has specific hardware requirements based on their expected needs.
