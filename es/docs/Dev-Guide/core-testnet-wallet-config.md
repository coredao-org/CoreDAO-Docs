#### Rebrand Updates

`Satoshi Chain/BTCs` have been rebranded to `Core Chain/CORE`, respectively. If you added the Testnet before the rebranding, you'll need to update Network Name and Currency Symbol in the MetaMask settings manually; otherwise, you won't be able to use the current version of Core Testnet. Go to `Settings->Network`, and select `Core Testnet` to open up the network settings. Update Network Name and Currency Symbol to the values stated in the [above section](#adding-network-manually) and click the Save button. You're good to go!
