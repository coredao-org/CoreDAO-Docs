# Bridging Tokens to Core With LayerZero (OFT V2)

![Core LayerZero OFT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac7382c0-6825-4fb8-91c2-5e022a2eca66)

---&#x20;

In this [guide](https://github.com/coredao-org/LZ-OFT-V2-Core-Guide), we walk you through the process of setting up cross-chain token transfers using LayerZero's Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) V2 protocol. Specifically, this guide focuses on enabling ERC-20 token transfers between Core Testnet and Base Sepolia Testnet, equipping developers with the necessary tools and knowledge to handle cross-chain token interactions.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, [this guide](https://github.com/coredao-org/LZ-OFT-V2-Core-Guide) will help you:

Set up and configure Hardhat for cross-chain deployments.
Deploy OFT contracts on Core Testnet and Base Sepolia Testnet.
Configure LayerZero endpoints and establish trusted remotes for secure communication between blockchains.
Execute cross-chain token transfers, allowing for efficient movement of assets across different blockchain networks.

If you're ready to dive in, access the full guide [here](https://github.com/coredao-org/LZ-OFT-V2-Core-Guide).

## Major Points Covered in the Guide:

- **Setting Up the Development Environment**: Install Node.js, pnpm, and Hardhat, then initialize your project to begin working with LayerZero's OFT V2 protocol.

- **Deploying OFT Contracts**: Follow step-by-step instructions for deploying contracts that enable cross-chain token transfers between Core Testnet and Base Sepolia.

- **Configuring Cross-Chain Peers**: Learn how to set trusted remotes and configure LayerZero pathways to ensure reliable and secure token transfers.

- **Executing Token Transfers**: Use Hardhat tasks to perform cross-chain token transfers, verifying the transactions on blockchain explorers.

- **Customizing the Token Setup**: While this guide focuses on bridging ERC-20 tokens, the OFT contracts can be adapted to meet different token requirements, whether fungible or non-fungible. You can modify the configuration for your unique token needs.

- For further customization and more in-depth configuration details, you can refer to [LayerZero’s documentation on OFT and EVM configuration](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oft/quickstart).

This resource will help guide you through any advanced setups not covered in this guide, ensuring you can tailor the process to your specific project requirements.

## Why This Guide is Important:

By implementing LayerZero’s OFT V2, you unlock the ability to create omnichain token ecosystems where tokens can be efficiently transferred across multiple blockchains. Bridging tokens between Core Testnet and Base Sepolia is used as an example because of its speed, and low fees. Via the endpoints provided by LayerZero, you're able to transfer tokens between Core any many different EVM networks. — this guide shows how easy it is to extend your project’s reach by enabling interoperability across networks. This opens up new possibilities for decentralized applications (dApps) that require token interactions across various blockchains, enhancing liquidity, scalability, and functionality.
