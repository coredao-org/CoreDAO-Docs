# Snapshot Node Configuration

---

Snapshots are important for a network to ensure nodes are able to sync up to the latest state of the network as quickly as possible. Before nodes can be used, they must sync up to the current state of the network, by starting from a recent snapshot these nodes can fast-track a majority of the syncing.

## System Requirements

There are several system requirements, both software and hardware, for setting up a snapshot node on the Core network.

### Software

- Currently, a Core Snapshot Node can only run on **Mac OS X** or on the **Linux** operating systems.

### Hardware

On the Core network, Snapshot nodes act also as the archive nodes, storing the enitre blockchain data.

#### Testnet Snapshot Node Hardware Specifications

For Snapshot Nodes on **Core Blockchain Testnet**, we recommend the following minimal hardware specs:

## Core Chain Snapshots

You can get the latest snapshots from [here](https://github.com/coredao-org/core-snapshots).

## Syncing Nodes Using Snapshots on Core Chain Network

On Core Chain network, you can sync your node to the latest state by several ways. In this document, we guide you through the syncing process of nodes on the Core network using the snapshots.

### Download Pre-Build Binaries

Download the pre-build binaries from the [release page](https://github.com/coredao-org/core-chain/releases/latest) or follow the instructions below

##### Linux

```bash
wget   $(curl -s https://github.com/coredao-org/core-chain/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep geth_linux |cut -d\" -f4)
mv geth_linux geth
chmod -v u+x geth
```

##### MacOS

```bash
wget   $(curl -s https://github.com/coredao-org/core-chain/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep geth_mac |cut -d\" -f4)
mv geth_mac geth
chmod -v u+x geth
```

### Download the config files

Download genesis.json and config.toml by:

```bash
wget   $(curl -s https://github.com/coredao-org/core-chain/releases/latest |grep browser_ |grep mainnet |cut -d\" -f4)
unzip mainnet.zip
```

### Peers Configuration

- **Mainnet**: the config.toml file from the latest release ships configured with the information about the `Bootstrap Nodes` and `Static Nodes` as shown below:

```yaml

```

### Download snapshot

Download latest chaindata snapshot from [here](https://github.com/coredao-org/core-snapshots).

### Start the Node

```bash
./geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node  --cache 8000 --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --txlookuplimit 0
```

:::note
Make sure you use the version of geth you downloaded with wget above, and not your local installation of geth, which might be the wrong version.
:::

:::tip
It is recommended to run a fast node, which is a full node with the flag --tries-verify-mode none set if you want high performance and care little about state consistency.

./geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node  --cache 8000 --rpc.allow-unprotected-txs --txlookuplimit 0 --tries-verify-mode none
:::

### Monitor node status

You can monitor the logs for node status. By default the logs are stored at `./node/logs/core.log`.

## Sync Mode

There are two sync modes for running a full node: **snap** and **full** which can be specified by flag **--syncmode**.

- The **snap** sync mode is used for initial sync, which will download the latest states rather than execute the blocks from the genesis. When the initial sync is done, it will switch to full sync automatically.

- The **full** sync mode can also be used to do initial sync, which will execute all the blocks since genesis. But it is **not recommended**, since the amount of historical data is too large. Instead, you can download a snapshot from the [official repo](https://github.com/coredao-org/core-snapshots) and start full sync from the snapshot.

- If the flag **--syncmode** is not provided, the default sync mode will depend on the state of the data folder. It will be **snap** mode if you sync from genesis or **full** mode if you start from a snapshot.
