This guide covers the essential steps for minting (wrapping) and redeeming (unwrapping) coreBTC, facilitating Bitcoin integration into decentralized finance (DeFi).

## Getting Started: Prerequisites

1. [Unisat Wallet Browser Extension](https://unisat.io/): Required for managing your BTC. Note that, Unisat currently has only desktop and Android wallet app.
2. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/): Necessary for interacting with the Core blockchain.

## Minting coreBTC

1. **coreBTC Website:** Go to https://bridge.coredao.org/coreBTC

Conversely, if the fee is set too low, the transaction may experience considerable delays in being mined, potentially taking days or even longer to process. It's crucial to find a balance that aligns with your urgency and the network's current demand.
