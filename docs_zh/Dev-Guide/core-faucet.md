# Core Testnet Faucet

---

To help users get started and allow developers to quickly prototype their dApps, Core has released the public [Core Testnet Faucet](https://scan.test.btcs.network/faucet) to distribute Core testnet tokens, **tCORE**.

## Steps to Obtain tCORE from Core Testnet Faucet

1. Navigate to the [faucet](https://scan.test.btcs.network/faucet) website.
2. Paste your address in the given textbox. Make sure you give the Core Testnet address of your wallet that you want to get funded with tCore.
3. Complete the CAPTCHA
4. Click the `Get tCORE` button. After requesting tCORE from the faucet, you'll see your MetaMask balance increase.

:::caution
Each address can request **only one tCORE per day**. If you've run out of tCORE and the faucet won't send you more because of the one tCORE daily limit, come back tomorrow and try again!

:::note
tCORE is only used for testing and does not have any value. Do not use it for real financial transactions.
