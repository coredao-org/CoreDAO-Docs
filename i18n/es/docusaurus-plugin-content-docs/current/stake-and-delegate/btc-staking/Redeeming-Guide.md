# Redeem Staked Bitcoin or Claim CORE Rewards

Core enables Bitcoin holders to earn CORE token rewards by timelocking their Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. For instructions on how to participate in Bitcoin timelocking and earn rewards, follow our detailed [guide](./stake-btc-guide.md).
After you've successfully created a Bitcoin timelock transaction, you'll want to know how to claim your earned CORE rewards and manage your timelocked Bitcoin. This guide explains the process when you see either the 'Redeem' option under 'Action' for your chosen validator, or the 'Claim' button next to 'Delegated Hash & Core Rewards' or 'Bitcoin Staking Rewards' in the interface.

## Reward Distribution Information

- **Distribution of Rewards:** CORE token rewards are distributed to stakers as incentives for their contribution to network security and governance.
- **Reward Source:** Rewards are sourced from the consensus reward pool.

## Redeem an Expired Staked Bitcoin

If your staking period has expired, redeem your staked Bitcoin assets from either Unisat or Xverse wallet(s). You must use the same wallet address during the staking process to redeem your expired staked Bitcoin.

1. From any Core screen, hover over your connected wallet in the top right corner → click **‘My Staking’**.
