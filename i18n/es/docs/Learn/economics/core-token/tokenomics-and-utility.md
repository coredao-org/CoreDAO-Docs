# CORE Tokenómica y utilidad

---

## Descripción general

CORE is the native utility and governance token of the Core blockchain. Its tokenomics follows principles of decentralization, sustainability, and long-term incentive alignment. CORE features a fixed supply cap similar to Bitcoin's model and was launched with emphasis on a fair and decentralized distribution.

## Distribución de tokens

CORE's tokenomics focuses on long-term sustainability and decentralized governance. The token serves multiple functions within the Core ecosystem, including validator rewards, transaction fee payments, and governance participation.

CORE has a fixed supply of **2.1 billion** tokens distributed across several key ecosystem functions. The allocation is structured to support network growth, security, and development as shown in the diagram below.:

1. **Node Mining (39.995% - 839,900,000 CORE tokens):**\
  Validator rewards for block production and network security, distributed over an **81-year** schedule to ensure long-term alignment with network growth.

2. **Users (25.029% - 525,600,000 CORE tokens):** Allocation for community airdrops and user participation incentives, designed to promote broad token distribution and ecosystem engagement.

3. **Contributors (15% - 315,000,000 CORE tokens):** Funds designated for past and future contributors who develop and maintain core protocols, infrastructure, and applications within the ecosystem.

4. **Reserves (10% - 210,000,000 CORE tokens):** Strategic reserve to support foundation operations and long-term network development initiatives.

5. **Treasury (9.5% - 199,500,000 CORE tokens):** Ecosystem development fund managed through governance to support grants, partnerships, and strategic investments in Core's growth.

6. **Relayer Rewards (0.476% - 10,000,000 CORE tokens):** Incentives for relayers who transmit data between Bitcoin and Core, supporting cross-chain consensus mechanisms.

## Utilidad de token

Los tokens CORE cumplen múltiples funciones críticas dentro de la red Core:

- **Transaction Fees:** All transactions and smart contract executions on Core require CORE tokens for gas payments.
- **Staking:** CORE tokens can be delegated to validators as part of Satoshi Plus consensus, contributing to network security and earning staking rewards.
- **Governance Participation:** Token holders can participate in on-chain governance, voting on network upgrades and protocol parameters.

## Suministro de sonido y emisiones

CORE has a fixed supply cap of **2.1 billion tokens**, adopting a scarcity model similar to Bitcoin. Validator rewards are distributed according to a predetermined **81-year** emission schedule designed for long-term sustainability.

- **Annual Reward Adjustment:** Block rewards decrease by **3.61%** annually, creating a gradual reduction curve rather than Bitcoin's halving model, providing more predictable economics for network participants.

## Política monetaria sólida

In addition to the hard cap, CORE also has a deflationary mechanism:

- **Quema de tarifas de transacción:** Una parte de las tarifas de transacción y las recompensas en bloque se quemarán, según lo determine la DAO, por lo que el suministro de tokens CORE se acerca asintóticamente al límite máximo sin excederlo.

## Conclusión

CORE tokenomics creates a balanced economic system that supports network security, governance, and utility. With a fixed supply cap, predictable emission schedule, and incentives aligned across Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin holders, and CORE token holders, the model supports sustainable ecosystem growth while preserving the network's decentralized nature. This design encourages long-term participation from stakeholders across both the Bitcoin and Core ecosystems.
