# stCORE - Liquid Staked CORE

---

## What is Liquid Staking?

Liquid Staking with stCORE enables CORE token holders to participate in network security while maintaining token liquidity. Unlike traditional staking where tokens become locked and unavailable for other uses, stCORE represents staked CORE tokens in a liquid, transferable form. This allows holders to simultaneously earn staking rewards and utilize their position across DeFi applications, effectively preserving capital efficiency while supporting network security.

## Pasos Involucrados en el Staking Líquido en Core

1. **Staking Setup:** Users convert their CORE holdings into staked CORE (stCORE) by depositing CORE into the stCORE staking contract, which automatically delegates the CORE to selected validators on the chain.

2. **Emisión de stCORE:** A cambio de hacer staking de CORE, los usuarios reciben tokens de staking líquido (stCORE). Estos tokens representan sus tenencias de CORE en staking y pueden ser comercializados o transferidos libremente mientras siguen ganando recompensas de staking.

3. **Staking Rewards:** Users earn annualized returns on their stCORE holdings through the increasing conversion ratio between stCORE and CORE. This means that over time, each stCORE token becomes redeemable for more CORE tokens, reflecting accumulated staking rewards.

## Beneficios del Staking Líquido en Core

1. **Liquidity:** Liquid staking on Core allows users to maintain the liquidity of their staked CORE tokens. While traditional CORE staking requires tokens to remain delegated to earn rewards ("stake & earn, unstake & stop earning"), stCORE tokens represent staked positions that can be freely transferred or utilized in DeFi applications without interrupting the underlying staking rewards.

2. **Earning Potential:** Core liquid staking enables users to earn staking rewards while simultaneously participating in the broader Core ecosystem. This dual functionality allows holders to benefit from validator rewards while also utilizing their assets across DeFi protocols, optimizing capital efficiency.

## Conclusión

Liquid staking on Core through stCORE provides an efficient mechanism for CORE holders to maximize their token utility while continuing to secure the network. By converting CORE to stCORE, users maintain exposure to staking rewards while gaining flexibility to trade, transfer, or utilize their assets in the broader ecosystem. As the Core network continues to develop, liquid staking represents a key infrastructure component that enhances capital efficiency and supports deeper DeFi integration.
