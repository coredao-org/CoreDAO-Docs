# Core Rev+ Revenue Sharing Model

---

## Introduction

Rev+ is Core's protocol-level mechanism that enables fee sharing by distributing a portion of transaction gas fees to various stakeholders, including stablecoin issuers, dApp developers, and DAOs. This innovative feature creates new economic models by allowing different stakeholders to receive a share of transaction gas fees, directly aligning incentives with network growth and activity.

## What is Rev+?

Core's Revenue Sharing Model, Rev+, is a generic framework built into the Core blockchain that distributes a portion of transaction gas fees to configured reward addresses when specific smart contract events are triggered. This system enables sustainable revenue streams for ecosystem participants, especially stablecoin issuers and developers, beyond traditional treasury yields or token-based incentives.

## Revenue Sharing Mechanism

Core's revenue sharing model, Rev+, supports two complementary mechanisms:

1. **Direct Distribution:** A portion of the transaction gas fees is automatically distributed to designated recipients (e.g., developers, DAOs, stablecoin issuers) with the transaction execution. This real-time mechanism ensures that value is immediately shared with contributors based on smart contract activity.

2. **Rev+ Pool Sharing:** A portion of gas fees is accumulated into a shared reward pool. At regular intervals (e.g., monthly), the fees from the pool are distributed among participating partners based on their relative contributions to network growth and usage. Contributions are assessed across four key metrics:

   - Total number of transactions
   - Aggregate transaction notional value
   - Number of unique active addresses
   - Total transaction fees generated

This dual-model architecture enables both precision-aligned incentives at the contract level and broader, data-driven revenue sharing across the entire ecosystem.

## Key Benefits

### For Stablecoin Issuers

Rev+ changes how stablecoin issuers generate value.

- **New Revenue Streams:** Rev+ offers a new, non-interest-based revenue stream from transaction activity, moving beyond traditional treasury yields
- **Reduced Distribution Costs:** By earning from the utility of their stablecoin, issuers can effectively reduce costs associated with distribution.
- **Aligned Incentives:** Revenue is directly correlated with the stablecoin’s real-world usage and adoption on the network, creating a powerful alignment of interests.

### **For Developers**

- **Direct Monetization:** Automatically receive a share of the gas fees generated by your dApp's usage, creating a new and sustainable revenue stream.
- **Rewarding Growth & Innovation:** Your earnings scale directly with user adoption and transaction volume, ensuring you are compensated for building valuable applications and fostering a vibrant community.
- **Focus on Product Quality:** Rev+ provides a direct path from user activity to developer revenue, eliminating the need for complex tokenomics or speculation. This enables devs to focus on crafting exceptional user experiences.
- **Sustainable Business Models:** Build additional recurring revenue streams from application activity, creating a sustainable business model that is not dependent on one-time token launches or fundraising.
- **Talent Attraction & Flywheel Effect:** The sustainable monetization model attracts more talent to the network, leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of growth that benefits you and the entire ecosystem by delivering higher-quality applications.

### **For the Ecosystem**

Rev+ is designed to create a vibrant, self-sustaining ecosystem where every participant is aligned and incentivized for long-term growth. This is built on three core principles: Aligned Growth, Sustainable Economics, and powerful Network Effects.

- **Aligned Growth:** All Rev+ participants, from builders to users, benefit from increased network activity. The more the network is used, the more value is created for everyone.
- **Sustainable Economics:** This model creates a long-term incentive structure that aligns value creation and value capture. By providing an additional revenue stream that scales with a dApp's adoption, more high-quality builders are attracted and rewarded. This increases the overall utility and usage of the Core blockchain, strengthening the entire ecosystem for the community.
- **Innovation Catalyst:** Encourages high-quality development and adoption
- **Network Effects:** As more participants join the Core ecosystem, a virtuous cycle of growth is created, benefiting everyone. This benefits everyone in several key ways:
  - A larger user base attracts more diverse and innovative applications, providing greater utility for everyone.
  - Increased utility leads to more usage and liquidity, which in turn boosts revenue for dApps and liquidity providers (LPs).
  - This rise in activity also generates more transaction fees for validators, further strengthening the network's infrastructure.

## Target Use Cases

- **Stablecoin Revenue Sharing:** Enable stablecoin issuers, such as USDC and AUSD, to earn revenue from every transfer, mint, or burn operation, thereby creating sustainable business models beyond treasury management.

- \***dApp Developer Incentives:** Allow DeFi applications, DEXs, and other protocols to earn ongoing revenue from user interactions, supporting long-term development and maintenance.

- \***DAO Treasury Monetization:** Allow whitelisted DAOs, whether they govern a protocol, service, or community, to receive protocol fee distributions triggered by specific contract events. This supports sustainable treasury growth without modifying existing contract logic or imposing direct charges on users.

## Economic Impact

Rev+ addresses critical challenges in the current blockchain ecosystem:

- **Misaligned Incentives**: Traditional models force stablecoin issuers to pay high upfront distribution costs without capturing transaction value
- **Developer Sustainability**: Most dApps struggle with long-term monetization beyond token appreciation
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Creates positive feedback loops where increased usage benefits all participants

Core’s Protocol Revenue Sharing Program, Rev+, is purpose-built to accelerate stablecoin adoption, incentivize developer activity, and drive sustained transaction volume across the network. Rev+ positions Core as the most attractive blockchain for stablecoin issuers, dApp developers, and ecosystem builders by aligning economic incentives with network growth. Through a phased and governance-driven rollout, Core aims to foster a robust, high-performance ecosystem that delivers long-term value to all participants.
