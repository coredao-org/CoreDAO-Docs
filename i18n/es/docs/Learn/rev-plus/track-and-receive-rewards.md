# How to Receive and Track Rev+ Rewards

---

Rev+ empowers developers, stablecoin issuers, and DAOs to earn a share of transaction fees generated by activity on their smart contracts. This guide outlines the steps to get your contract configured for Rev+ rewards and explains how to monitor and track your earnings on-chain.

## Apply for Rev+ Revenue Distribution

1. Apply for the Core Rev+ Program through the application form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc66PEWiBcZA7UVehEsQKdzuS_8lwnG7R4AAi3SApIhdUWuWA/viewform).
2. Upon submission, the project will be thoroughly evaluated and reached out for information regarding Rev+ configurations, such as the list of events that trigger the fee distribution, reward addresses, rewards split details, etc.

## How to Track Your Rev+ Direct Distribution Rewards

- Navigate to [scan.coredao.org](http://scan.coredao.org)
- Paste Your Reward Address in the search bar.
- **Access the Fee Distribution Tab:** Once your reward address is entered, an extra tab called _Fee Distribution_ will appear. Here, you can see all your fee distributions and track your Rev+ rewards in detail.

- **Monitor Event Triggers in the State Tab:** Whenever a Rev+ enabled transaction is triggered, the **State tab** on Core Scan displays configured contract events that were triggered by the transaction, making it easy to verify which actions led to fee distributions.
