# Core 101: The Bitcoin Everything Chain

---

## What is Core?

Core is a high-performance, EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain secured by Bitcoin. It unlocks trustless yield for Bitcoin holders and Bitcoin miners who help in securing the leading Bitcoin scaling ecosystem via Core's Satoshi Plus consensus.

### Satoshi Plus Consensus

Core's unique consensus mechanism brings together three distinct stakeholder groups to secure the network:

- **Self-Custodial Bitcoin Staking**: Bitcoin holders timelock their coins in order to vote for Core validators

- **Delegated Proof of Work**: Bitcoin miners delegate existing hash power in order to vote for Core validators

- **Delegated Proof of Stake**: CORE token holders lock their coins in order to vote for Core validators

This tripartite system for the election of Core validators creates a robust, multi-layered security model that leverages Bitcoin's proven security while enabling high-performance blockchain operations.

### EVM-Compatible Bitcoin Ecosystem

Bitcoin stakers, CORE stakers, and Bitcoin miners combine to vote for validators to secure the Core network. Elected validators are high-performant, reputable, and efficient, allowing Core to process sophisticated transactions rapidly and at low cost to users.

Additionally, the Core blockchain is fully EVM-compatible, meaning that developers can seamlessly build Ethereum-style applications, smart contracts, and tools directly on Core with minimal modifications, thereby expanding the ecosystem's utility and attracting projects across DeFi, stablecoins, gaming, NFTs, and other high-utility sectors.

## The Bitcoin Yield Challenge

Bitcoin does not generate native yield like Proof of Stake chains. However, Bitcoin does support native timelocks through its CLTV OP_CODE, which lets Bitcoin holders lock their coins on the Bitcoin blockchain to make them unspendable during the designated timelock period.

### Timelocks Unlock Trustless Yield

Core allows Bitcoin's native timelocks to unlock trustless yield. When Bitcoin holders timelock their coins on the Bitcoin blockchain, they earn the right to vote for validators on Core. Elected validators then secure the Core blockchain by producing blocks and validating transactions. Securing Core earns validators and their voters a share of Core's consensus rewards pool. This is how Bitcoin holders can earn real yield without moving their Bitcoin. No bridging. No lending. No wrapping. Just holding.

### Where Yield Comes From

Core's consensus rewards pool is made up of fixed block rewards and gas fees from network activity.

**Block rewards**: 81 years of fixed emissions from ~40% of CORE's 2.1 billion total token supply, distributed with a 3.61% annual reduction rate.

**Gas fees**: Network activity that generates transaction fees will gradually replace block rewards as the primary yield mechanism, similar to Bitcoin's own model.

### Dual Staking

Bitcoin Staking yields are tiered, with the higher tiers of yield reserved for those most aligned with the Core network, as represented by staked CORE relative to staked Bitcoin. Therefore, Bitcoin stakers are incentivized to become CORE stakers in order to access the highest reward tiers.

By being the exclusive key unlocking higher Bitcoin staking yields, the CORE token can become the second asset that Bitcoiners care aboutâ€”not by competing with Bitcoin, but by complementing it.

## Something for Everybody

No matter what kind of Bitcoiner you are, Core has something for you. Core transforms Bitcoin into the central asset of a high-performance DeFi environment, turning idle Bitcoin into productive Bitcoin within a variety of frameworks.

- **Conservative Bitcoin Holders**: Earn trustless yield while keeping complete custody of your coins

- **Bitcoin Users**: Access fast, low-cost transactions on the leading Bitcoin scaling solution

- **Yield Maximizers**: Stake CORE tokens alongside Bitcoin for enhanced Dual Staking rewards

- **DeFi Users**: Deep Bitcoin liquidity and an expansive dapp environment

- **Builders**: Deploy on the fastest-growing Bitcoin ecosystem with full EVM compatibility

- **Bitcoin Miners**: Earn supplemental rewards without changing your mining operations

- **Institutional Holders**: Timelock Bitcoin and stake CORE for premium yields, or access liquid lstBTC with professional custody

- **Institutional Traders**: Use lstBTC as capital-efficient collateral while earning Bitcoin-denominated yield

- **Structured Products Providers**: Build Bitcoin yield products using Core's institutional-grade infrastructure

Wherever you are on your Bitcoin journey, Core meets you there - expanding what's possible with Bitcoin without changing what makes Bitcoin special.
