# Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

---

## Descripción general

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is the component of **Satoshi Plus consensus** that enables CORE token holders to participate in network security by voting for validators via the delegation of tokens.

DPoS establishes a **direct economic relationship** between CORE token holders and network security:

- CORE token holders gain voting power and earn rewards proportional to their stake
- Validators compete for delegation to increase their election probability
- The network benefits from distributed token-holder participation in validator selection

## How DPoS Works

### 1. Token Delegation

CORE token holders participate by delegating their tokens to chosen validators:

- **Delegate CORE tokens** to one or more validators
- **Voting power** is proportional to the amount of CORE tokens delegated
- **Modify delegations** at any time

### 2. Validator Election

Validators with higher total delegated CORE tokens have higher probability of being elected to the active validator set for block production.

### 3. Reward Distribution

When validators produce blocks:

1. Validators earn CORE token rewards
2. Validators take a commission (set by each validator)
3. Remaining rewards are distributed proportionally to delegators based on their stake

## Best Practices for Delegators

- Research validator performance and commission rates before delegating
- Monitor validator uptime regularly
- Consider diversifying delegation across multiple validators
- Claim rewards regularly

## Getting Started

**To participate in DPoS:**

1. **Research validators** and their commission rates
2. **Select validator(s)** and delegation amount
3. **Confirm delegation** and begin earning rewards

## Why It Matters

DPoS enables CORE token holders to directly participate in Core's consensus mechanism, creating economic alignment between token ownership and network security. Combined with Bitcoin miner delegation and Bitcoin staking, DPoS contributes to Core's multi-layered security model.
