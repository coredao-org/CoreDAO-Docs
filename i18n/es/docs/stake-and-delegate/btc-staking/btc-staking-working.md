# CÃ³mo Funciona el Staking Autocustodiado de Bitcoin {#how-self-custodial-bitcoin-staking-works}

---

## CLTV Timelock Mechanism

[`CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV)`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Timelock#CheckLockTimeVerify) is a Bitcoin-native function that locks transaction outputs until a specified time or block height. When you create a CLTV transaction:

- Bitcoin remains locked in your wallet for the specified duration
- No third party can access your Bitcoin during the lock period
- You retain full custody throughout the entire process
- After expiration, you must send a redeem script to regain spending ability

## Staking Process Overview

1. **Create timelock transaction** with CLTV on Bitcoin blockchain
2. **Include metadata** specifying validator delegation and reward address
3. **Core relayers detect** valid staking transactions on Bitcoin
4. **Earn CORE rewards** based on validator performance and staked amount
5. **Redeem Bitcoin** after timelock expires using redeem script

## Security Model

**Zero Custodial Risk**: Your Bitcoin never leaves the Bitcoin blockchain or your control. The staking mechanism uses only Bitcoin-native functions without introducing additional trust assumptions.

**Key Security Guarantees**:

- Bitcoin remains in your wallet throughout staking
- No protocol-level risk beyond Bitcoin's native security
- No third-party custody or smart contract risk
- Validator misbehavior cannot affect your Bitcoin principal

## Technical Requirements

### Transaction Structure

Your CLTV staking transaction must include:

**Required Outputs**:

- **CLTV timelock output**: Locks your Bitcoin for specified duration
- **`OP_RETURN` output**: Contains delegation metadata

**Metadata Format** (in `OP_RETURN`):

- Core validator address (delegation target)
- CORE reward address (where to send rewards)

### Minimum Requirements

| **Method**       | **Minimum BTC**          | **Minimum Duration**                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Official UI      | 0.01 BTC | 5 days                                    |
| Direct scripting | No minimum               | 24 hours (recommended) |

## Cross-Chain Operations

| **Paso**     | **Red de Bitcoin**                                     | **Red de Core**                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initiate** | User creates CLTV transaction with delegation metadata | Relayers monitor for valid staking transactions    |
| **Timelock** | Bitcoin locked in user's wallet, transaction confirmed | Relayers validate and register staking position    |
| **Earn**     | Bitcoin remains locked and secure                      | CORE rewards accrue based on validator performance |
| **Redeem**   | User sends redeem script to unlock Bitcoin             | Relayers update staking records                    |

### Timeline and Activation

**Confirmation Process**

1. **Transaction broadcast**: CLTV transaction sent to Bitcoin network
2. **Bitcoin confirmation**: ~60 minutes (6 blocks) for recognition
3. **Core detection**: Relayers identify valid delegation
4. **Reward activation**: Next validator election round (~24 hours from UTC+0)

**Example Timeline**
If you stake Bitcoin at 6:00 AM UTC+0:

- Bitcoin confirmation: Same day after 6 blocks
- Staking becomes active: 12:00 AM UTC+0 next day
- Rewards begin accruing: From first active round

## Best Practices

### Transaction Fees

- **Use competitive fees**: Low fees cause confirmation delays
- **Monitor network congestion**: Adjust fee rates accordingly
- **Consider RBF**: Enable Replace-By-Fee for fee adjustments

### Handling Delays

- **Transaction accelerators**: Use services like viaBTC if stuck
- **Fee bumping**: Increase fees on pending RBF transactions
- **Patience**: Low-fee transactions may take days during congestion

### Validator Selection

Choose validators based on:

- Performance history and uptime
- Commission rates
- Community reputation

## Redelegation vs Redemption

**Redemption**: Unlock Bitcoin for general use

- Requires redeem script after timelock expires
- Bitcoin becomes fully spendable again

**Redelegation**: Switch to different validator without unlocking

- Can be done directly without redemption
- Maintains staking position with new validator

## API and Data Access

Staking data becomes available via Core Staking API once:

- Bitcoin transaction is confirmed (6 blocks)
- Relayers have processed the delegation
- Staking position is active in validator elections

This allows developers to track staking positions, rewards, and validator performance programmatically.
