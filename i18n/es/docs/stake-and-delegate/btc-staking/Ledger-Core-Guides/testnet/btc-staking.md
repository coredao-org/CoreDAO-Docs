# Using Ledger Hardware Wallets for BTC Staking on Core

This user guide walks you through the process of staking BTC to earn CORE rewards on the Core blockchain using a Ledger hardware wallet. By following the steps below, you can participate in Core’s Self-Custodial Bitcoin Staking while maintaining complete control of your assets.

## Before You Begin: Important Reminders

To ensure a secure and seamless experience, please note the following key requirements:

1. **Use Only Supported Ledger Devices:** Bitcoin staking, redemption, and redelegation on Core is only supported on specific Ledger hardware wallets with the latest firmware. Always update your device through Ledger Live before proceeding.

2. **Always Use the Ledger’s Core App:** You must use Ledger’s Core Testnet app, not the standard Bitcoin app, when staking or redeeming BTC on Core Testnet. Staking BTC with the Bitcoin app may result in the inability to redeem your BTC, resulting in permanent loss of assets.

3. **Stake BTC Only from the Primary BTC Wallet Address:** BTC staking is currently supported from your Ledger’s primary BTC wallet address only. Secondary or derived addresses are currently not compatible.

4. **Only Native Segwit Bitcoin Address Type Supported:** Currently, only Native SegWit Bitcoin addresses are supported for BTC staking via Ledger hardware.

## Supported Ledger Hardware Wallets

The following Ledger hardware devices currently support staking, redemption, and redelegation of BTC on the Core Testnet. For the best experience and compatibility, ensure your device is running the latest available firmware.

| Ledger Device      | Firmware Version (_at the time of writing_) |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ledger Nano S+** | 1.4.0                          |
| **Ledger Nano X**  | 2.5.0                          |
| **Ledger Stax**    | 1.8.0                          |
| **Ledger Flex**    | 1.4.0                          |

<br/>

:::important
The firmware versions listed above reflect the latest available at the time of writing and are subject to change. Before staking, redeeming, or redelegating Bitcoin on Core Testnet using your Ledger device, as a best practice, update to the latest compatible version to ensure compatibility and security. Always check Ledger Live for the most current updates. Refer [here](https://support.ledger.com/article/8458939792669-zd) for more details on updating the Ledger drive firmware.
