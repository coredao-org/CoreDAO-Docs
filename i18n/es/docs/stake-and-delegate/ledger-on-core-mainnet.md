## Supported Ledger Hardware Wallets

Currently, the following Ledger hardware devices support Bitcoin Staking directly on Core.

ℹ️ Please update to the newer versions available to ensure compatibility and security.

:::note
For staking BTC on Core with a Ledger device, it’s recommended to **only** use the CoreDAO app. Unlike the Bitcoin app, which relies on blind signing, the CoreDAO app supports Clear Signing, allowing users to fully view and verify transaction details before signing and approving them.

    - Setting the lock time determines when your staked Bitcoin will be unlocked and available again for redemption or re-delegation. The default lock time is set to a month in advance.
