# RPC Endpoints for Core Network

---

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoints are vital for developers to connect directly with the blockchain, enabling data retrieval, transaction execution, and smart contract management. With both mainnet and testnet endpoints available, developers can test and deploy their applications seamlessly within the Core blockchain ecosystem.
