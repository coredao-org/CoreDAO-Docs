# Using Ledger Hardware Wallets for Staking CORE

---

This user guide walks you through the process of staking CORE to earn staking rewards on the Core blockchain using a Ledger hardware wallet. By following the steps below, you can participate in Core’s Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism by staking and delegating CORE.

## Before You Begin: Important Reminders

To ensure a secure and seamless experience, please note the following key requirements:

1. **Use Only Supported Ledger Devices:** CORE staking is only supported on specific Ledger hardware wallets with the latest/supporting firmware. As a best practice, update your device through Ledger Live before proceeding.

2. **Always Use the Ledger's Ethereum App:** You _must_ use Ledger's Ethereum app to stake CORE token on Core using Ledger device.

## Supported Ledger Hardware Wallets

The following Ledger hardware devices currently support staking CORE directly on the Core blockchain. For the best experience and compatibility, ensure your device is running the latest available or supported firmware.

| Ledger Device      | Firmware Version (_at the time of writing_) |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ledger Nano S+** | 1.4.0                          |
| **Ledger Nano X**  | 2.5.0                          |
| **Ledger Stax**    | 1.8.0                          |
| **Ledger Flex**    | 1.4.0                          |

:::note
The firmware versions listed above reflect the latest available at the time of writing and are subject to change. Before staking CORE using your Ledger device, update to the latest version to ensure compatibility and security. Always check Ledger Live for the most current updates. Refer [here](https://support.ledger.com/article/8458939792669-zd) for more details on updating the Ledger drive firmware.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A supported Ledger device with the latest firmware.
- Ledger Live is installed and set up on your computer.
- Your Ledger device is added to your EVM Wallet that you desire to use (e.g., MetaMask)
- Sufficient CORE tokens (minimum 1 CORE) available on your Ledger device for staking, including tokens to cover transaction fees.

## Setting up Ledger Device

Before staking CORE, make sure your Ledger hardware wallet is fully updated and ready to use with the Core blockchain.

### Step 1: Update Your Ledger Device

Ensure your Ledger device is updated and ready for use.

1. Open **Ledger Live** on your computer.
2. Connect and unlock your Ledger device.
3. Navigate to **My Ledger** in the sidebar.
4. If prompted, allow **Ledger Manager** access on your device.
5. Install any available firmware updates for your device, skip if your device has the latest supported firmware.

### Step 2: Installing the Ledger Ethereum app

Follow the steps below to install the Ledger Ethereum app on your device.

1. With your device connected to your computer, open the Ledger Live application and navigate to "**My Ledger**".

2. Under the "**App Catalog**", search for "**Ethereum**".

3. Install the "**Ethereum**" app. Use _only_ the Ledger Ethereum app for staking CORE using Ledger on Core Mainnet. For more details, refer to the [official guide](https://support.ledger.com/article/360009576554-zd) from Ledger for installing the Ethereum app on your device.
