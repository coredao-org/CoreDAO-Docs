# CORE Token Overview

---

CORE is the native token of the Core blockchain and **the exclusive key to unlocking higher Bitcoin staking yields**. As Bitcoin holders discover they can earn meaningful yield on their Bitcoin through Core's Self-Custodial Bitcoin Staking, they quickly learn that the highest yields are reserved for those who also stake CORE tokens through Dual Staking. Simultaneously, CORE is essential for accessing Core's thriving Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem—from paying transaction fees to participating in network governance.

This creates a compelling dual value proposition: CORE is positioned to become **the second asset that Bitcoiners hold**—both as the essential tool for maximizing Bitcoin's productivity and as the utility token of Bitcoin's most active scaling solution.

## The Yield Advantage

- Solo Bitcoin staking provides base-level yields
- **Dual Staking** (Bitcoin + CORE) unlocks up to ~25-50x higher yields
- Higher CORE-to-Bitcoin ratios unlock progressively higher yield tiers

This creates natural demand for CORE tokens among Bitcoin holders who want to maximize their Bitcoin's productivity. As more Bitcoin enters Core's staking system, demand for CORE tokens is designed to increase proportionally.

## Core Functions

**Dual Staking Enhancement:** CORE tokens unlock higher Bitcoin staking yields through Dual Staking, with higher CORE-to-Bitcoin ratios providing access to premium yield tiers.

**Network Operations:** CORE serves as the gas token for all Core network transactions and smart contract operations.

**Governance:** CORE holders participate in protocol governance decisions and parameter changes.

**Validator Security:** Validators must post a CORE token bond as slashable collateral for network participation.

## Tokenomics

CORE mirrors Bitcoin's scarcity model with a **fixed supply cap of 2.1 billion tokens**—exactly 100x Bitcoin's 21 million supply. This creates a compelling parallel: as Bitcoin adoption grows and more Bitcoin seeks yield through Core, there remains a fixed supply of CORE tokens to unlock the highest yields.

The emission follows an 81-year schedule with a 3.61% annual reduction rate for consensus block rewards, creating predictable, gradually decreasing issuance similar to Bitcoin's halvings but with a smoother curve.

## Value Drivers

**Staking Demand:** As Bitcoin staking grows on Core, demand for CORE tokens is designed to increase proportionally. Bitcoin holders must acquire and stake CORE to access the highest yield tiers.

**Ecosystem Demand:** CORE tokens are required for engaging with Core's leading Bitcoin-powered dapp ecosystem. As ecosystem activity expands, CORE is expected to play an increasingly important role—much like native tokens on other popular Layer 1 blockchains.

## Fixed Supply Dynamic

The key insight is the interplay between two fixed supplies:

- **Bitcoin**: 21 million maximum supply
- **CORE**: 2.1 billion maximum supply (100x Bitcoin)

As more Bitcoin seeks trustless yield and more CORE is staked to unlock higher yields, both assets become increasingly scarce. This creates a virtuous cycle where:

1. Bitcoin holders stake their Bitcoin to earn yield
2. They acquire and stake CORE tokens to access higher yield tiers
3. Both Bitcoin and CORE become locked in staking, reducing liquid supply
4. Scarcity increases the value proposition for both assets
5. Greater value propositions attract more participants, repeating the cycle

This dynamic positions CORE as **the primary companion asset to Bitcoin** for anyone serious about generating trustless yield on their Bitcoin holdings.
