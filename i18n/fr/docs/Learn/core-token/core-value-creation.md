# CORE Value Creation

---

CORE is positioned to be the second asset that Bitcoiners care about—not by competing with Bitcoin, but by complementing it. CORE is the native token of the leading Bitcoin-powered smart contract platform, providing utility across Core's expansive ecosystem of decentralized applications. On top of this foundational ecosystem utility, CORE provides additional genuine utility to Bitcoin holders through Dual Staking as the required asset for accessing higher Bitcoin staking yields on Core. These ecosystem and yield utilities are underpinned by CORE's tokenomics, which are designed to align long-term incentives across both the Bitcoin and Core ecosystems.

## CORE's Value Proposition for Bitcoin Holders

In addition to CORE's utility as the native token of the leading Bitcoin-powered smart contract platform, Bitcoin holders discovering Core face a compelling economic reality: CORE tokens are the key to unlocking higher Bitcoin staking yields. While solo Bitcoin staking provides base-level returns, Dual Staking with CORE tokens unlocks significantly enhanced yields—often up to ~25-50x higher.

Access to the highest yield tiers requires maintaining specific CORE-to-Bitcoin ratios, creating immediate utility-driven demand for CORE tokens among Bitcoin holders seeking to maximize their Bitcoin's productivity. The yielded CORE tokens they receive are the gateway to accessing Core's smart contract platform.

## The Utility of CORE Token Emissions

Unlike yield farming projects that exist primarily to distribute rewards, CORE serves as the foundational utility token of a high-performance, EVM-compatible blockchain and thriving Bitcoin scaling ecosystem. The token's sustainable value stems from both its role in powering this ecosystem and its utility in unlocking enhanced Bitcoin yields.

## Core's Growing Ecosystem Runs on CORE

Many Bitcoin holders retain CORE because they see long-term growth potential in the broader ecosystem. Core is a comprehensive Bitcoin-powered smart contract platform with extensive dapp activity, significant total value locked, and substantial transaction volume.

This active ecosystem creates genuine utility for CORE tokens beyond staking incentives. Users need CORE for transaction fees, governance participation, and accessing various DeFi services across the network.

As the Core ecosystem continues to expand, the value proposition of the CORE token grows in parallel—much like the native assets of other leading Layer 1 platforms—as demand for its utility increases for application usage.

## Yield Dynamics Incentivize Holding

In addition to unlocking ecosystem access, CORE tokens also provide value to Bitcoin holders through unlocking higher Bitcoin staking yields via Dual Staking. This creates a compelling economic proposition: by acquiring CORE tokens, holders can immediately access enhanced yields they would otherwise accumulate gradually over time.

Rather than waiting to build positions through rewards, Bitcoin holders can optimize returns by directly acquiring CORE or borrowing against their staked Bitcoin. This system incentivizes upfront demand for CORE rather than passive accumulation, creating a stronger and more immediate impact.

## Sustainable Tokenomics

- Fixed maximum supply of 2.1 billion tokens
- 81-year emission schedule with gradual annual reduction
- Predictable, decreasing issuance creating long-term sustainability

CORE's approach resembles Bitcoin's own supply mechanics but with a smoother reduction curve, designed for sustainable, multi-decade growth rather than short-term incentives.

## The Multiplier Effect

The mathematics behind CORE's staking dynamics and emissions schedule encourage up-front commitments that significantly outweigh a year's—or even multiple years'—worth of emissions.

**Educational Example** (not indicative of live data): If staking 100 CORE tokens at the highest yield tiers earns 25 CORE in annual rewards, the up-front commitment is 4x greater than a year's worth of accumulated staking rewards, thereby incentivizing long-term alignment rather than short-term farming.

## Becoming Bitcoin's Companion Asset

CORE is complementing Bitcoin's value proposition for a variety of holders and users, including:

- **Bitcoin users** can use Bitcoin assets within Core's EVM-compatible dapp ecosystem, accessing faster transaction speeds, lower costs, and more sophisticated interactions than are available on the base Bitcoin layer.

- **Bitcoin miners** — traditionally among the most Bitcoin-maximalist participants — are now staking a portion of their rewards in CORE.

- **Institutional Bitcoin treasuries** are exploring and deploying capital into Core's Dual Staking.

- **ETP/ETF issuers** — already holding large Bitcoin positions — are using Core to earn trustless yield on otherwise idle Bitcoin.
  - Valour's yield-bearing BTC ETP has generated 5.65% APY exclusively using Core's staking offerings.
  - Issuers are also exploring lstBTC, the upcoming liquid, yield-bearing Bitcoin token pioneered by Maple Finance.
