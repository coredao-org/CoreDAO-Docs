# lstBTC: Institutional Bitcoin Yield

---

## The Big Idea

Bitcoin is the world’s largest digital asset, yet it remains financially idle—held in vaults or posted as collateral without generating yield. Institutions have traditionally faced a dilemma:

- **HODL BTC** as a store of value, leaving it unproductive.
- **Lend BTC**, taking on counterparty risks, illiquidity, and operational complexity.

**lstBTC changes that.**

For the first time, institutions can earn BTC-denominated yield **without relinquishing custody, lending risk, or disrupting workflows**. Powered by **Core’s Dual Staking**, risk-managed by **Maple Finance**, and secured by **custodians like BitGo, Hex Trust, and Copper**, lstBTC transforms Bitcoin into a **yield-bearing asset with full liquidity and security**.

## **What is lstBTC?**

lstBTC is a **liquid, yield-bearing Bitcoin token** issued on the Core blockchain, designed for institutional investors seeking **BTC-native yield** without compromising security.

Unlike traditional BTC yield solutions, lstBTC **does not require**:

- Lending BTC (eliminating counterparty risk).
- Wrapping BTC onto another chain (avoiding bridging risks).
- Giving up custodial control (Bitcoin remains in institutional custody).

Instead, lstBTC:

- Generates **3-6%+ BTC yield** via Core’s **Dual Staking**.
- Ensures BTC remains custodied by **BitGo, Copper, and Hex Trust**.
- Is risk-managed by **Maple Finance** to **protect yield sustainability and BTC principal**.

## **How lstBTC Works**

For institutional users, lstBTC is **simple and seamless**:

1. **Deposit BTC** with a trusted custodian (BitGo, Copper, or Hex Trust).
2. **Receive lstBTC 1:1**, which accrues BTC-denominated yield daily.
3. **Use lstBTC as BTC**—trade, transfer, or pledge it as collateral.
4. **Redeem lstBTC for BTC + Yield** at any time through the original custodian.

- **No custody changes**: BTC remains where institutions already store it.
- **No capital inefficiency**: BTC earns returns instead of sitting idle.
- **No workflow disruptions**: lstBTC integrates seamlessly into financial operations.

## **How lstBTC Generates Yield**

lstBTC’s yield is powered by **Core’s Dual Staking mechanism**, a capital-efficient BTC yield strategy:

- **BTC is collateralized** via a low **10% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio loan** to purchase CORE.
- **Maple Finance** manages risk by using options strategies to hedge against CORE price fluctuations.
- **CORE and BTC are Dual-Staked** on Core’s blockchain, earning block rewards and fees.
- **Yield is converted into BTC**, ensuring **all returns are BTC-denominated**.

**Risk Management**:

- BTC principal is **protected from extreme market moves**.
- **Negligible liquidation risk** due to conservative LTV ratios.
- **Dynamically managed yield** to balance rewards and security.

## **Who is lstBTC For?**

🔹 **Institutional BTC Holders** – Funds, treasuries, and wealth managers looking for **BTC yield**.\

**Key Use Case**:
