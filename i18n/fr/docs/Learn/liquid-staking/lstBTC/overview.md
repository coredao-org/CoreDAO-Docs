# lstBTC : Rendement Bitcoin Institutionnel

---

## What is lstBTC?

**lstBTC (Liquid Staked Bitcoin)** is a yield-bearing token that represents Bitcoin + accrued yield through Core's **Dual Staking** mechanism. It offers **yield denominated in CORE or Bitcoin**, **full asset liquidity**, and **institutional-grade custody**.

## Product Structure

### Custodial Backing

Principal Bitcoin is held with trusted custodians including **BitGo**, **Copper**, and **Hex Trust**. These institutions safeguard the Bitcoin and authorize its use in Maple Finance's yield-generating strategies without compromising control.

### Yield Generation

Managed via Maple Finance's institutional strategy:

- **Bitcoin Collateralization**: Deposited Bitcoin serves as collateral
- **CORE Acquisition**: Stablecoins are borrowed against Bitcoin to acquire CORE tokens
- **Dual Staking Implementation**: Both Bitcoin and CORE are staked to access Satoshi Tier yields
- **Risk Management**: CORE price exposure is hedged to protect Bitcoin collateral
- **Yield Distribution**: Generated rewards flow to lstBTC

### Token Properties

- **Full Backing** — Each lstBTC represents one Bitcoin plus accrued yield
- **Asset Liquid** — Tradable, usable across DeFi, and postable as collateral
- **Institutionally Secure** — Bitcoin remains with participating custodians
- **Real Yield** — Yield denominated in CORE or Bitcoin

## Key Benefits
