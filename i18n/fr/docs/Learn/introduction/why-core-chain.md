# Pourquoi Core

---

Core est la chaîne Bitcoin simplement dit - une couche-1 haute performance compatible EVM alimentée par Bitcoin. Sécurisé par les mineurs de Bitcoin, les détenteurs de Bitcoin et les stakers de CORE via le consensus Satoshi Plus, Core fonctionne comme une plate-forme de contrats intelligents complémentaire à Bitcoin.

## Caractéristiques distinctives.

Some of the major characteristics that set Core apart are:

- **Bitcoin-aligned:**  Core's architecture complements Bitcoin through dual integration: Bitcoin holders can timelock their coins to participate in consensus while maintaining self-custody, and Bitcoin miners can participate by delegating their hash power. Their extension of security to Core earns them yield as the Core and Bitcoin communities work symbiotically.

- **Decentralized:** Core's decentralization is primarily facilitated through the three-part system by which validators are elected under Satoshi Plus consensus. Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin stakers, and CORE token stakers all participate in Core's validator election, resulting in broad participation and economic alignment.

- **Secure:** Core's security is bolstered by several pillars, starting with the Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism that leverages Bitcoin's hashrate and value to provide differentiated security. Validators must post bonds that can be slashed for malicious behavior, adding a strong incentive layer for honest operation without putting delegators' funds at risk. Additionally, validators can be jailed for infractions, temporarily removing them from the active set. Furthermore, multiple network-level safeguards deter potential threats, creating a robust security framework that combines Bitcoin's proven security model with modern proof-of-stake protections.

- **Scalable:** As an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain optimized for performance, Core delivers high transaction throughput and low confirmation times while maintaining decentralization. This scalability enables a growing ecosystem of applications and use cases that require both performance and Bitcoin's security foundation, without the bottlenecks typical of the Bitcoin base layer.

- **Permissionless:** Anyone can participate in Core's ecosystem without gatekeepers or special requirements. Bitcoin holders can timelock their Bitcoin, CORE holders can stake their tokens, developers can deploy applications, and users can interact with the platform—all without seeking approval or meeting qualifying criteria. This open access drives innovation and ensures broad participation.

- **Community Governed:** The Core blockchain’s governance is a blend of immutable and mutable components. Les aspects immuables sont ceux qui doivent être maintenus en place, comme la quantité totale de CORE. Néanmoins, d'autres aspects de la gouvernance en chaîne bénéficieraient d'une certaine adaptabilité. For those, Core's governance model is designed to give stakeholders direct influence over the network's evolution through on-chain voting mechanisms.

- **Interoperable:** Core's EVM compatibility enables seamless interaction with the broader EVM ecosystem and other compatible chains. This interoperability allows developers to easily port applications across ecosystems and enables users to access a wide range of services and assets. Additionally, Core's Bitcoin integration creates unique cross-chain functionality not available on standard EVM chains.

- **Composable:** Core achieves composability through its support of the Solidity smart contract language, enabling developers to create contracts that can seamlessly interact with one another through function calls, token transfers, and dynamic contract creation. This interoperability allows for the development of sophisticated, interlocking systems that power a wide range of applications—from peer-to-peer lending platforms and liquidity pools to trading systems and real-time on-chain data services—creating a rich ecosystem where components can be combined in innovative ways.

## Core propose une solution pour chacun.

Core is the Bitcoin Everything Chain with offers for every type of Bitcoiner or DeFi user. Important audiences include:

- **Bitcoin Holders:** Transform your idle Bitcoin into a productive asset through simple timelocking, earning sustainable yield without giving up custody, wrapping your Bitcoin, or exposing it to smart contract risk.

- **Bitcoin Users:** Access a high-performance environment with fast, affordable transactions and sophisticated applications without compromising your Bitcoin-centric approach. Core's EVM compatibility delivers speed and functionality beyond the Bitcoin base layer, letting you explore DeFi opportunities while still supporting Bitcoin miners and benefiting from their consensus participation.

- **Institutions:** Earn sustainable yield on Bitcoin holdings without compromising security, triggering tax events, or introducing counterparty risk. Core's timelocking mechanisms transform Bitcoin from an idle asset with negative carry into a productive portfolio component while maintaining compliance with institutional requirements.

- **DeFi Users:** Explore a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications powered by Bitcoin's security and Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. Core's high throughput and low fees make complex DeFi strategies viable, allowing you to execute sophisticated transactions and access innovative financial products while benefiting from the security foundations of the Bitcoin network.

- **Web3 Enthusiasts:** Beyond DeFi, Core's Turing-complete environment enables a wide spectrum of blockchain applications. From NFTs and gaming to social platforms and digital identity, Core provides an open canvas for those who believe in a decentralized, user-owned internet where Bitcoin's security model enhances rather than constrains innovation.

- **Builders:** Core offers a familiar, permissionless environment where Solidity developers can seamlessly deploy applications without learning new languages or frameworks. Supported by a robust ecosystem of development tools and infrastructure providers, Core connects builders with a vibrant community of users eager for Bitcoin-powered innovations, creating unique opportunities at the intersection of Bitcoin's security and smart contract functionality.

- **Bitcoin Miners:** Core’s Delegated Proof of Work unlocks a second block reward for Bitcoin miners who are always searching for critical income. Furthermore, Core extends the protection of Bitcoin miners beyond the mere Bitcoin asset, and onto an ecosystem that can fully unlock the potential of that asset.

- **Partisans du Bitcoin :** Même sans s'engager personnellement avec la blockchain Core, les partisans du Bitcoin peuvent apprécier comment Core s'aligne sur le Bitcoin pour améliorer à la fois le réseau et l'actif Bitcoin. With better compensated, and therefore more highly incentivized miners, the Bitcoin network grows stronger, while the Bitcoin asset gains a sophisticated smart contract environment.

- **Croyants en la liberté :** Core est une blockchain entièrement permissionless, permettant à n'importe qui dans le monde de participer. Cet éthique favorise les opportunités financières pour les communautés qui peuvent le plus bénéficier de l'émergence et de la popularité du Bitcoin et de la technologie blockchain.
