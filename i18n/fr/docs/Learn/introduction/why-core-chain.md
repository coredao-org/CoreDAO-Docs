# Pourquoi Core

---

Core is Bitcoin’s first Proof of Stake (PoS) layer and the largest Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem, merging the unparalleled security of Bitcoin with the scalability of the Satoshi Plus consensus. Core unlocks Bitcoin-native yield, Bitcoin-powered smart contracts, a second block reward for miners, and an end-to-end Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem.

Overall, Core represents a paradigm shift in how we use Bitcoin. It amplifies its role as a Store of Value through the Bitcoin Risk-Free Rate and facilitates its transition to Medium of Exchange by providing Bitcoin-secured, yet hyper-scalable blockchain rails for more efficient transactions and a variety of other use-cases. Core’s approach not only aligns with Bitcoin’s ethos of decentralization, transparency, and permissionlessness, but also safeguards and enhances the base Bitcoin network.

## Key Distinguishing Features of Core

Core is a decentralized, secure, and scalable blockchain network backed by Bitcoin’s PoW. Some of the major characteristics that sets it apart from its competitors are as follows:

- **Bitcoin-aligned:**  Core is designed to unlock Bitcoin's protection by enabling Bitcoin miners to delegate their security to an EVM-compatible smart contract platform and subsidize Bitcoin mining by providing CORE token rewards to Bitcoin miners that require no added expense or opportunity cost. While Bitcoin serves as the defender of a perfectly scarce, passive monetary asset, Core is designed to be the decentralized rails upon which digital assets, like Bitcoin, gain substantial utility. Furthermore, Core offers a risk-free rate to Bitcoin Stakers who are rewarded financially in the Core  ecosystem in return for staking their Bitcoin. These rewards can be in the form of block rewards through delegations or staking awards through staking Bitcoin onto Core. Currently, over **75%** of Bitcoin mining hash power and through the ground-breaking innovation of Non-Custodial Bitcoin staking more than **8,200** Bitcoins are already contributing to Core's security model.

- **Decentralized:** Core's decentralization is facilitated through the three-part system by which validators are elected under Satoshi Plus consensus. On the one hand, Bitcoin miners can vote for validators by writing data into the coinbase transactions of newly-mined Bitcoin blocks (DPoW). On the other, CORE token holders can vote for validators by delegating CORE tokens to them (DPoS). Because Bitcoin hash power and CORE tokens are highly distributed, both the DPoW and DPoS aspects of Satoshi Plus consensus work together to uphold Core blockchain’s decentralization. Bitcoin Stakers also play an important role in decentralziation of the Core network as well. They aid in validator elections alongside with CORE token holders in DPoS, leveraging Bitcoin's distributed hash power.

- **Secure:** Core blockchain’s security rests on several pillars. The most important of these is the Satoshi Plus Consensus Mechanism, which achieves decentralization through a combination of DPoW, DPoS, and Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking. The combination of these leverages Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin Stakers and Core Stakers to maintain the security of the network. Through the Core blockchain’s security model, the network can thwart consensus attacks through its incentive structures, which feature rewards for participants that identify malicious nodes and mechanisms for punishing those nodes, and it incorporates checkpointing and similar safeguards for preventing other kinds of long-range attacks. To further strengthen its network and avoid any attacks that may rise due to loopholes in the codebase, Core blockchain’s codebase is audited from several top-tier blockchain security firms.

- **Scalable:** Core is highly scalable, capable of eventually a large user base of participants, with high transaction throughput and low latency. This is due in part to the fact that DPoS is inherently more scalable than either standard PoS or PoW, and in part to the fact that the network can increase the rate at which blocks are mined by adding many more validators. What’s more, there will be additional scaling solutions developed on top of the network in the future.

- **Permissionless:** Core blockchain’s permissionlessness means anyone can participate in and build on Core, without approval or authorization from any gatekeeping entity. The network’s decentralization, open-source software, and consensus model are designed to maintain this permissionlessness in perpetuity.

- **Community Governed:** Core blockchain’s governance is a blend of immutable and mutable components. The immutable aspects are those that must be kept in place, like the total supply of CORE. Nonetheless, other aspects of on-chain governance would benefit from adaptability. For those, the decentralized autonomous organization responsible for network development, Core DAO, is designed to become progressively more decentralized as on-chain participation grows. All CORE token holders will be able to vote on the adaptations of certain protocol parameters. As stakeholders in the network, Bitcoin Stakers potentially influence Core blockchain’s governance through their economic stake and participation in consensus activities. Their involvement ensures that a broad base of the community, including those invested in Bitcoin, has a say in the evolutionary path of the network's protocols and policies.

- **Interoperable:** Core can interface with a wide variety of blockchain projects. Because it is EVM compatible all protocols on Core can interact with one another, Ethereum-based protocols can be ported to Core with relative ease, and cross-chain solutions allow communication across other blockchains. Other than EVM compatibility, Core also offers interoperability with Bitcoin in the form of Non-custodial Bitcoin Staking, where users can stake their Bitcoin onto the Core without having to give up the custody of their assets maintained on the Bitcoin network. Further, coreBTC offers Bitcoin the interoperability to be bridged onto the Core blockchain and be used in the DeFi landscape.

- **Composable:** For Core, composability is achieved through support of the popular Solidity smart contract language. Solidity allows developers to create smart contracts that can call functions within other contracts, send CORE tokens to them, and even create new contract instances. This allows for the building of complex interlocking systems of contracts able to facilitate peer-to-peer borrowing and lending, open liquidity pools, trading platforms, live, accurate on-chain data, and much more.

## Core Offers Something for Everybody

Core is a blockchain synthesis that unlocks something for everybody. Here are some of the many interested groups and how Core supports them:

- **Bitcoin Holders:** Core puts your Bitcoin to work without requiring you to give up custody. Bitcoin holders can earn the Bitcoin Risk-Free Rate through Core’s Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking. Without bridging your Bitcoin or even necessarily engaging in Core DeFi, Bitcoin holders can earn more by simply continuing to hold.

- **Bitcoin Users:** For those interested in using Bitcoin as a Medium of Exchange, Core makes Bitcoin transactions and financial activity practical with its fast, efficient, and Bitcoin-protected blockchain rails. On Core, the Bitcoin asset gains a tailor-made financial ecosystem its users can enjoy permissionlessly.

- **Institutions:** Core offers institutions innovative yield opportunities through Bitcoin staking. By collaborating with top custodians and asset managers, Core enhances Bitcoin’s capital efficiency and programmability, enabling new financial products like lstBTC, Valour’s yield-bearing BTC ETP, and CoreFi, a CBOE-listed leveraged security. Institutions can benefit from Core’s secure infrastructure, access to on-chain yield, and seamless integration with Bitcoin.

- **Utilisateurs de DeFi :** Les experts en DeFi peuvent retrouver de nombreux cas d'utilisation familiers dans l'écosystème dapps de Core, car Core est entièrement compatible EVM et prend en charge une variété de cas d'utilisation de smart contracts. De nombreuses opportunités de prêt, d'emprunt, d'échange et d'autres activités sont disponibles. Cet écosystème jeune et en pleine croissance constitue une excellente opportunité pour les vétérans de la DeFi de commencer leur voyage BTCfi.

En outre, Core étend la protection des mineurs de Bitcoin au-delà de l'actif Bitcoin lui-même, vers un écosystème qui peut pleinement exploiter le potentiel de cet actif.

- **Partisans du Bitcoin :** Même sans s'engager personnellement avec la blockchain Core, les partisans du Bitcoin peuvent apprécier comment Core s'aligne sur le Bitcoin pour améliorer à la fois le réseau et l'actif Bitcoin. Avec des mineurs mieux récompensés, et donc plus incités, le réseau Bitcoin devient plus fort, tandis que l'actif Bitcoin bénéficie d'un environnement sophistiqué de smart contracts.

- **Croyants en la liberté :** Core est une blockchain entièrement permissionless, permettant à n'importe qui dans le monde de participer. Cet éthique favorise les opportunités financières pour les communautés qui peuvent le plus bénéficier de l'émergence et de la popularité du Bitcoin et de la technologie blockchain.
