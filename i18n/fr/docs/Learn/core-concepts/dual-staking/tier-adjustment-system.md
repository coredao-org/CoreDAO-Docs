# Tier Adjustment System

---

## Overview

Core's tier adjustment system maintains sustainable and attractive yields for Dual Staking participants through dynamic management of CORE-to-Bitcoin ratio requirements. The system is designed to balance yield attractiveness with tier accessibility, ensuring that participants most aligned with Core receive consistently favorable rewards.

## How Tier Adjustments Work

### Primary Mechanism

The most important lever Core uses is adjusting the **CORE-to-Bitcoin ratio requirement** for accessing the Satoshi Tier and other yield tiers.

### Adjustment Triggers

**When Too Many Participants Qualify for Satoshi Tier:**

- The same reward pool gets split among more participants
- Individual yields decrease for all Satoshi Tier participants
- The protocol raises the CORE-to-Bitcoin requirement
- Fewer participants qualify, increasing yields for remaining participants

**When Too Few Participants Qualify for Satoshi Tier:**

- Yields become very attractive but highly inaccessible
- High barriers limit participation to a small subset of stakers
- The protocol lowers the CORE-to-Bitcoin requirement
- More participants gain access, creating more balanced yield distribution

## Key Factors Influencing Adjustments

Several variables determine when and how tier requirements change:

- **Participation Levels**: How many participants qualify for each tier
- **Asset Prices**: Current market prices of CORE and Bitcoin
- **Reward Pool Distribution**: How rewards are split across tiers
- **Network Alignment Goals**: Maintaining incentives for Core-committed participants

## Practical Examples

### Scenario 1: Increasing Requirements

1. Dual Staking adoption grows significantly
2. Many new participants qualify for Satoshi Tier
3. Individual yields decrease due to reward pool dilution
4. Protocol increases CORE-to-Bitcoin requirement for Satoshi Tier
5. Some participants drop to lower tiers
6. Remaining Satoshi Tier participants see yield recovery

### Scenario 2: Decreasing Requirements

1. Market conditions make Satoshi Tier very exclusive
2. Only a small number of participants qualify
3. High yields but limited accessibility
4. Protocol decreases CORE-to-Bitcoin requirement
5. More participants gain Satoshi Tier access
6. Yields become more balanced across broader participant base

## Impact on Participants

### For Existing Satoshi Tier Participants

- May need to increase CORE holdings to maintain tier status
- Benefit from higher yields when requirements increase
- Incentivized to maintain strong CORE-to-Bitcoin ratios

### For Lower Tier Participants

- May gain access to higher tiers when requirements decrease
- Motivated to acquire more CORE tokens for tier advancement
- Can plan CORE accumulation strategies around adjustment patterns

## Monitoring Adjustments

Participants can track tier requirement changes and their impact through:

- **Live monitoring** at [stake.coredao.org/staking](https://stake.coredao.org/staking)
- **Announcements** via official Core channels

## Why It Matters

The tier adjustment system ensures that Core's Dual Staking mechanism remains economically sustainable and continues to incentivize the behavior most beneficial to the network: Bitcoin stakers becoming CORE stakers and demonstrating long-term commitment to the Core ecosystem. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where network growth supports participant rewards, and participant rewards drive network growth.
