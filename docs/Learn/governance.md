# Governance on Core

---

## Overview

Core's governance system empowers the community to actively participate in decision-making processes that shape the ecosystem's future, from protocol changes to feature implementations. The governance is facilitated through the CORE token and follows a progressive decentralization approach.

## Progressive Decentralization

The Core blockchain's governance is designed to evolve over time, with a phased approach that begins with necessary centralization for network establishment and progressively hands over control to the community as it grows and stabilizes.

## Active Governance Features

- **On-chain parameter adjustment** for fixed network parameters
- **'m Parameter'** governing certain economic variables is under community control
- **Fee burn percentage** (currently set at 0%) subject to on-chain governance
- **Time delays in voting** being discussed to mitigate vote selling concerns
- **Validator set changes** including the approval of expansions to the validator set

## Progressive Decentralization Strategy

### Stage 1: Off-Chain Governance

- Proposals and decisions conducted off-chain through Core Improvement Proposals (CIPs)
- Community members could submit proposals regardless of stake size
- Majority vote determined outcomes with seven-day voting periods

### Stage 1.5: Hybrid Model

- Midpoint between off-chain governance and partial on-chain governance
- Allowed for learning, adjustment, and laying groundwork for more on-chain elements

### Stage 2: Partial On-Chain Governance (Current)

- Ability to adjust fixed parameters directly through on-chain voting
- 'm Parameter' is under community control
- Additional parameters like the fee burn percentage subject to on-chain governance

### Stage 3: Full On-Chain Governance

- Details currently being developed with active community participation
- Plans include requiring collateral to post proposals
- Ensures proposers have vested interest in network health and longevity
