# Overview of the Core Blockchain

---

## Introduction

Core is a high-performance, EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, designed to be Bitcoin's complementary and hyper-scalable smart contract platform. By leveraging Bitcoin-native CLTV timelocks, Bitcoin mining hash power, and modern smart contract capabilities, Core unlocks Bitcoin as both the prime protector and central asset of a thriving decentralized application ecosystem.

### The First Self-Custodial Bitcoin Staking Mechanism

Satoshi Plus's Self-Custodial Bitcoin Staking component is the first live self-custodial Bitcoin staking mechanism, allowing Bitcoin holders to earn trustless yield without introducing new trust assumptions.

### Harnessing Bitcoin's Security & Empowering Miners

Currently, Satoshi Plus benefits from the security of ~75% of all Bitcoin mining hash power through delegation. By involving miners in validator elections, it leverages Bitcoin's unmatched decentralization while offering miners supplemental rewards, addressing the long-term decline in Bitcoin block rewards.

## Core Technology

### Satoshi Plus Consensus

This innovative consensus mechanism combines Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW), Self-Custodial Bitcoin Staking, and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) thereby incorporating Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin stakers, and CORE stakers, respectively, in the election of Core validators. Each of these three legs of Satoshi Plus introduces a new layer of security and incentive alignment.

### Advanced Smart Contract Capabilities

Core functions as a fully EVM compatible Layer 1 blockchain, providing developers with a robust and familiar environment to build and deploy applications. This deep compatibility enables seamless integration of existing Ethereum-based dapps with minimal modifications, accelerating ecosystem growth while leveraging established development tools, libraries, and best practices.

### High Performance

Core's advanced validator election process enables the decentralized selection of high-performance and efficient block producers, resulting in rapid transaction speeds and low costs. The protocol's design preserves both decentralization and operational efficiency.

### Cross-Chain Interoperability

As a scalable, EVM-compatible blockchain, Core offers extensive cross-chain capabilities:

- **Core Bridge**: Powered by Layer Zero, the Core Bridge facilitates effortless asset transfers between Core and other blockchains
- Integrations with multiple cross-chain decentralized applications and bridges

### Usability and Accessibility

- **User-Friendly Interfaces**: Products on Core are easily accessible through several commonly used wallets and interfaces
- **Comprehensive Developer Tools**: An extensive suite of tools to help developers build, deploy, and manage applications on Core

### Governance and Community Engagement

The Core blockchain features a foundational on-chain governance process. Key decisions—including changes to on-chain parameters, rewards mechanisms, and protocol adjustments—are enhanced through community participation and on-chain voting, giving users a direct say in the platform's development.

## Conclusion

Core maximizes Bitcoin's utility while building a thriving Bitcoin-powered financial ecosystem through its unique Satoshi Plus consensus. By bringing together Bitcoin miners, CORE holders, and Bitcoin holders, Core creates a secure, decentralized platform where Bitcoin's fundamental strengths are enhanced, not compromised. This approach opens new possibilities for everyone in the ecosystem while cementing Bitcoin's role as the cornerstone of an open, permissionless digital economy.
