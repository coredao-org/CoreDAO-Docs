# Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking FAQs
---

### Why is that the staking address provided differs from your original Bitcoin address?
The staking address is derived from your wallet's master private key, ensuring your control and security over your assets. Your Bitcoins remain safely stored in your original wallet, unaffected by staking. While staked assets may not be visible in some wallet versions, you still have complete ownership. 

You can view your staked funds by searching the staking address on the any BTC explorer like (Mempool)[https://mempool.space/]. We're actively working to make staked assets visible in all supported wallets especially through command line versions.

### Does Core provide any hardware wallet support for Non-Custodial BTC Staking?

At present, Non-Custodial BTC Staking does not support hardware wallets due to technical constraints. Nevertheless, we're constantly exploring ways to enhance compatibility with various wallet types, prioritizing both security and convenience for our users.

### What are the important considerations for Locking Periods to keep in mind before staking your assets?

* **Time Lock Expiration:** When you lock your Bitcoin for staking, it's inaccessible until the staking period concludes.
* **Choosing wisely:** We advise selecting your locking period thoughtfully, taking into account your investment objectives and risk tolerance. Starting with shorter locking periods can help you become familiar with the process before committing to longer durations.
* **Staked Amount Verification:** currently due to some technical complexities it is possible that your staked asset is not visible in your wallet when checked through CLI, however, you can easily verify that you have the complete ownership of your staked assets from [Core's official Non-Custodial BTC Staking Website](https://stake.coredao.org/).
