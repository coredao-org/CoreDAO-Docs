# Redeem Staked Bitcoin or Claim CORE Rewards

Core offers Bitcoin holders to stake their assets onto the Core blockchain to ear passive income in the form of CORE tokens. To learn how to stake your Bitcoin assets onto Core and earn rewards, follow our detailed [guide](./stake-btc-guide.md). After you have succesfully staked your Bitcoin on the Core blockchain, next up is to learn to claim your CORE rewards or redeem your staked Bitcoin. This detailed guide will be utilized when you see ‘**Redeem**’ appear under ‘**Action**’ on the delegated validator you chose previously or ‘**Claim**’ next to ‘**Delegated Hash & Core Rewards**’ and or ‘**Bitcoin Staking Rewards’**.

## Reward Distribution Information

* **Distribution of Rewards:** CORE token rewards are distributed to stakers as incentives for their contribution to network security and governance.
* **Reward Source:** Rewards are sourced from the consensus reward pool shared between participants of Core's dual mechanisms: dPoW (Bitcoin miners) and dPoS (Bitcoin and CORE stakers).

## Redeem an Expired Staked Bitcoin

If your staking period has expired, redeem your staked Bitcoin assets from either Unisat or Xverse wallet(s). You must use the same wallet address during the staking process to redeem your expired staked Bitcoin.

1. From any CORE screen, hover over your connected wallet in the top right corner → click **‘My Staking’**.
