# lstBTC: Institutional Bitcoin Yield
---

## The Big Idea
Bitcoin is the world’s largest digital asset, yet it remains financially idle—held in vaults or posted as collateral without generating yield. Institutions have traditionally faced a dilemma:  
- **HODL BTC** as a store of value, leaving it unproductive.  
- **Lend BTC**, taking on counterparty risks, illiquidity, and operational complexity.  

**lstBTC changes that.**  

For the first time, institutions can earn BTC-denominated yield **without relinquishing custody, lending risk, or disrupting workflows**. Powered by **Core’s Dual Staking**, risk-managed by **Maple Finance**, and secured by **custodians like BitGo, Hex Trust, and Copper**, lstBTC transforms Bitcoin into a **yield-bearing asset with full liquidity and security**.

## **What is lstBTC?**  
lstBTC is a **liquid, yield-bearing Bitcoin token** issued on the Core blockchain, designed for institutional investors seeking **BTC-native yield** without compromising security.  

Unlike traditional BTC yield solutions, lstBTC **does not require**:  
* Lending BTC (eliminating counterparty risk).  
* Wrapping BTC onto another chain (avoiding bridging risks).  
* Giving up custodial control (Bitcoin remains in institutional custody).  

Instead, lstBTC:  
* Generates **3-6%+ BTC yield** via Core’s **Dual Staking**.  
* Ensures BTC remains custodied by **BitGo, Copper, and Hex Trust**.  
* Is risk-managed by **Maple Finance** to **protect yield sustainability and BTC principal**.  

## **How lstBTC Works**  
For institutional users, lstBTC is **simple and seamless**:  
1. **Deposit BTC** with a trusted custodian (BitGo, Copper, or Hex Trust).  
2. **Receive lstBTC 1:1**, which accrues BTC-denominated yield daily.  
3. **Use lstBTC as BTC**—trade, transfer, or pledge it as collateral.  
4. **Redeem lstBTC for BTC + Yield** at any time through the original custodian.  

* **No custody changes**: BTC remains where institutions already store it.  
* **No capital inefficiency**: BTC earns returns instead of sitting idle.  
* **No workflow disruptions**: lstBTC integrates seamlessly into financial operations.  

## **How lstBTC Generates Yield**  
lstBTC’s yield is powered by **Core’s Dual Staking mechanism**, a capital-efficient BTC yield strategy:  
- **BTC is collateralized** via a low **10% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio loan** to purchase CORE.  
- **Maple Finance** manages risk by using options strategies to hedge against CORE price fluctuations.  
- **CORE and BTC are Dual-Staked** on Core’s blockchain, earning block rewards and fees.  
- **Yield is converted into BTC**, ensuring **all returns are BTC-denominated**.  

**Risk Management**:  
* BTC principal is **protected from extreme market moves**.  
* **Negligible liquidation risk** due to conservative LTV ratios.  
* **Dynamically managed yield** to balance rewards and security.
