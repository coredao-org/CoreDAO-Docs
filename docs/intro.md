# Core DAO - Decentralized Applications Secured by Bitcoin

## üë®‚Äçüíª Getting Started


Core is a hyper-scalable smart contract platform designed to complement Bitcoin, serving as its first Proof of Stake (PoS) layer and the largest Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. By merging Bitcoin‚Äôs unmatched security with the scalability of the innovative Satoshi Plus consensus, Core expands Bitcoin‚Äôs capabilities while preserving its core principles of decentralization and security. With approximately 75% of Bitcoin mining hash power already contributing to Core‚Äôs security model and over 8,200 BTC staked through Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking, Core strengthens Bitcoin's role as both the prime protector and central asset of the future of DeFi. Core's Dual Staking model further empowers Bitcoin holders to earn secure and sustainable yields by staking both BTC and CORE, all while retaining full control and ownership of their assets.
