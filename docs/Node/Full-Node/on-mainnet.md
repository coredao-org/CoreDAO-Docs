# Running Core Full Nodes on Core Mainnet
---

A Core full node stores the entire history of the Core blockchain, enabling anyone to verify the state of any account. A Core full node can take many forms:

* **Normal full node**: for private use.
* **Validator full node**: acts as a validator on Core, validating blocks and transactions.
* **RPC full node**: provides RPC services and responds to HTTP requests.

:::note
This document provides a detailed guideline on running Normal Full Nodes on the Core network.

## System Requirements

There are several system requirements for setting up a Full Node on Core.

### Software Specifications for Full Nodes on Core Mainnet

* Currently, a Core Full Node can **_only_** run on **Mac OS X** and **Linux**.

### Hardware Specifications for Full Nodes on Core Mainnet

Core nodes perform several resource-intensive tasks, which can include storing blockchain data, verifying blocks or transactions, communicating with peer nodes, and answering network requests, depending on their configuration. For full nodes on **Core mainnet**, we recommend the following minimal hardware specs:

| Requirements   | Details                                                                                                 |  
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Storage        | 1 TB of free disk space                                                                                 |
| CPU            | 4 CPU cores                                                                                             |
| RAM            | 32 Gigabytes                                                                                            |
| Internet Speed | A broadband Internet connection with upload/download speeds of 5 Mbps                                   |


## Build and Run Full Node on Core Mainnet

1\. We recommend using the [core-chain](https://github.com/coredao-org/core-chain) GitHub repository to directly build and run your full node, running your full node directly from our blockchain codebase. Instructions for building the source code can be found in the repository's [README](https://github.com/coredao-org/core-chain#building-the-source).

2\. Download the node binary from the[ releases page](https://github.com/coredao-org/core-chain/releases) of the core-chain repository. The node binary includes the relevant mainnet and testnet configuration files. This is the [latest version](https://github.com/coredao-org/core-chain/releases/latest).

3\. Write the genesis state locally by executing the following command from your project directory:

```bash
geth --datadir node init genesis.json
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
INFO [07-18|14:57:20.715] Maximum peer count                       ETH=25 LES=0 total=25
INFO [07-18|14:57:20.721] Allocated cache and file handles         database=/Users/jackcrypto/go/core-chain/node/geth/chaindata cache=16 handles=16

INFO [07-18|14:57:20.730] Successfully wrote genesis state         database=lightchaindata                             hash=d90508…5c034a
```

4\. Our full node is ready, let's start running it!

If you plan to run a normal node, you can just run the following `geth` command directly:

```bash
## start a full node
geth --config ./config.toml --datadir ./node  --cache 8000
```

5\. As our full node runs, we can monitor its logs to make sure that everything is operating correctly. The log file is located at `/node/logs/core.log` by default, but can be changed to another location if desired.
