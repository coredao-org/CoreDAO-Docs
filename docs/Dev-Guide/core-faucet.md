:::caution
Each address can request tCORE2 **only once per day** from the faucet within a 24-hour period. If you've run out of tCORE2 and the faucet won't send you more because of the daily limit of one tCORE2, come back after 24 hours and try again. Alternatively, you can request it in Core's [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/coredaoofficial).

:::note
tCORE2 are only test tokens and is only used for testing and do not have any value. Do not use it for real financial transactions.
