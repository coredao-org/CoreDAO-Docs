:::caution 
Each address can request **only one tCORE or tCORE2 per day** from the faucet in 24 hours. If you've run out of tCORE or tCORE2 and the faucet won't send you more because of the one tCORE or tCORE2 daily limit, come back after 24 hours and try again. Or else you can request in Core's Discord Server.

:::note
tCORE and tCORE2 are only used for testing and does not have any value. Do not use it for real financial transactions.
