# Core Blockchain Network RPC Endpoints
---

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoints are crucial for developers and applications to interact directly with the blockchain, allowing them to retrieve data, submit transactions, and execute smart contracts seamlessly. The availability of both mainnet and testnet endpoints facilitates development and testing phases, enabling developers to build, test, and deploy their applications in a controlled environment before going live. Whether you are looking to deploy a decentralized application, conduct transactions, or access blockchain data, these RPC endpoints are essential tools for navigating and leveraging the Core blockchain ecosystem.
