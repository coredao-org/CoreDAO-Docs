# Core Ignition FAQs
---

### 1. What is Core Ignition?   
  
Core Ignition is a six-month incentive program developed by the Core Foundation to jumpstart the growth of Core ecosystem. Season 1 has concluded on September 11, 2024, and Season 2 is currently live. Please visit [Core Ignition](https://ignition.coredao.org) for further details.

  
### 2. What is Core blockchain? 
  
Core serves as the Proof of Stake layer for Bitcoin, pioneering Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking and securing a fully EVM-compatible BTCfi ecosystem. Since April 2024, over 5,500 BTC have been staked with Core, boosting Bitcoin’s utility and security. Core is the most Bitcoin-aligned EVM blockchain, with approximately 55% of Bitcoin mining hash power contributing to the network’s security.

  
### 3. I am new to Core ecosystem. How do I get started?  

For new users to the Core blockchain, here's some essential information:
1. To interact with Core, the users need its native token, CORE, in their wallet.
2. For first-time users, Core offers a one-time benefit to help users get started:
    * If users bridge at least 10 USDT to Core, users qualify for the Core Faucet.
    * This Faucet automatically deposits some CORE into the user's wallet.
3. The process works as follows:
    * First, funds are bridged (minimum 10 USDT) to the Core blockchain.
    * Upon successful bridging, Core will automatically deposit CORE into the user's wallet.
    * With CORE now in the user's wallet, users can immediately begin transacting on the Core blockchain.

Remember, this automatic CORE deposit is a one-time benefit designed to help new users easily start using the Core blockchain.

  
### 4. Difference between Core Ignition versus Core Ignition Builder’s incentive program? 

The Core Ignition incentive program rewards loyal users to foster growth in Core’s BTCfi ecosystem. In contrast, the Core Ignition Builder’s incentive program rewards developers for creating dApps/projects on the Core blockchain.

  
### 5. I don’t have any Bitcoin token (BTC). Can I still participate in Core’s BTCfi ecosystem?  

Absolutely! Users can still participate in Core's BTCfi ecosystem even without holding Bitcoin. As an EVM-compatible chain, Core offers a range of DeFi opportunities similar to other EVM chains, including DEXes, lending protocols, perpetual futures, restaking, and NFT platforms. Core's mission is to unlock $1.25T of trapped Bitcoin liquidity, creating opportunities for all web3 users.
